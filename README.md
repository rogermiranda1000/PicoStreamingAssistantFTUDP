# VRCFaceTracking - Pico 4 Pro/Enterprise Module

> Let VRCFaceTracking use the Pico 4 Pro/Enterprise's face tracking data via the Streaming Assistant, PICO Connect, or Business Streaming.

## Setup **Pico 4 Pro Module** for **VRCFaceTracking**.

1. Download the latest Streaming Assistant/PICO Connect (for PICO 4 Pro), or Business Conect (for PICO 4 Enterprise)
2. Download and install the Pico 4 Pro Module

* Installer
  * Install `Pico4SAFTExtTrackingModule` from VRCFaceTracking's **Module Registry** tab.
* Manual
  * Download the [Latest Release](https://github.com/regzo2/PicoStreamingAssistantFTUDP/releases)
  * Include the supplied **.dll** release in `%appdata%/VRCFaceTracking/CustomLibs` (create the folder if is not there).

3. Launch VRCFaceTracking. **VRCFaceTracking v5.0.0.0 is required to use Pico 4 Pro Module.**


For more information, refer to the [PICO module VRCFT wiki entry](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/hardware/pico4pe).

## Troubleshooting

> The Pico 4 Pro is not connecting to VRCFaceTracking using the module.

Make sure that your Pico 4 device is capable of using face tracking. 
At this time only the Pico 4 Pro/Enterprise is capable of being used with this module.
Make sure you have the latest streaming software capable of sending 
face tracking data.
